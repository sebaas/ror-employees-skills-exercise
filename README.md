Exercise for accomplish the self training Ruby on Rails course.

Requirements:

Build an Employee’s skills CRUD application with user’s accounts developed in Ruby on Rails. 

The users can enter the app by logging in (creating an account  if needed). They can write a project and choose the skills, performed in that project, from a predefined list and, optionally, add a new skill to a free text field. Each project will have two dates, the starting date and the ending date (which can be empty if it is an ongoing project)
An administrator user will add skills to the list. He also will be able to see the whole information about all employees, export them to an excel spreadsheet and search for a particular skill (it will show the employees that have that skill). 
This exercise should take between 8 and 16 hs. 
The exercise will be delivered to the training team to evaluate the knowledge acquired from the self study.

Estimated Time:
8-16hs

Instructions:
Clone the repository. Install the gem bundler. Execute bundle install.
Follow the features described in cucumber (features/*.feature) to build the system. Through bundle exec cucumber check that the step successfully runs. Uncomment the file test/factories.rb as you create the models in order to build the basic information needed for each test.

Good Luck!
